// Finding the vertex cover for a n-way tree.
// The approach is greedy.
// We choose the vertex with degree 1. Then focus on its neighbour.
// because to accommodate this vertex, its neighbour must be in the vertex cover.
// We delete this node as well as the neighbour from the map, reduce the degrees of all the nodes connected to the neighbour by 1 and include the neighbour in the vertex covering.
// repeat till no more vertices in the map.
